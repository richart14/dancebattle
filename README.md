#### How to install

1. Go to the directory you want to save the project in the terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/richart14/dancebattle.git`

2. run `npm install` to install all necessary react related modules. 

3. run `npm start` and the app should be showing up on a localhost server.

#### Interface Design Problem


1. Please create a live webpage that is split into four quadrants.
2. The top left and the bottom right quadrant should have a background color of red
3. The quadrants should be responsive, or resize with the browser
4. In the center of the top right quadrant, display the text “dance”
5. In the center of the bottom left quadrant, display the text “battle”

The page itself should be responsive. I didn't have the ability to see the png file so I just assumed it was a 4 quadrant with red backgrounds on each of the given parts.

#### Algorithms Problem

1. Build a searching for song feature (listed below)
2. Write a function that takes a search parameter string as input, and outputs an array of matching songs
3. Assume that you have an array of song objects locally, and that you do not have to make a database call to receive the object
4. Only display results when the search parameter has 2 or more characters in the input
